## About me
I have worked for six years as a Software Engineer creating web applications for tech companies including Quickbooks and Xero.

Before that I worked for eight years as a web editor for the Natural History Museum. So I know both the technical and content side of website creation.

## How I work
<ul>
  <li><span>I focus on simplicity; I’ll make sure you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need.</span></li>

  <li><span>If content updates are needed over time, we can set up a simple CMS so that you can do that yourself.</span></li>

  <li><span>I can set up hosting, if needed, but will then handover to you so that you’re not paying me ongoing charges.</span></li>
</ul>
